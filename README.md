Research Question/Topics:
  Analysis related to EV market penetration
  Aim to create a robust project that can model market penetration of Electric Vehicles vs a variety of demographic indicators nationally.
  Ie postcodes, socio-economic factors, state.

  Further analysis
  Make comparisons to non EV sources, and draw conclusions as to adoption rates
  Make comparisons to countries with similar economic indicators

Data Sources:
Categories
  Ev data
  Census data
  Ownership by suburb
  Changes over time (multiple year datasets)
  Compare to other countries?
